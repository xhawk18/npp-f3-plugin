Why npp-f3-plugin?

   npp-f3-plugin makes hotkey F3 in notepad++ as old ultraedit style --
   1. Select text and press F3, search selected text
   2. Do not select text and press F3, continue previous search
   
   
How to install?

   Just copy jN.dll and jN folder to "plugins" folder in Notepad++'s install directory is OK.
   After copied the files, restart Notepad++.
